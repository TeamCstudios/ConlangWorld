### Book 2: The Epic of Birekuhomustano
#### Forward:
These books are taken from the journals of a man named Dxaredo Txalüanto de la Mahatasato. I've translated most of the text, but I've included the original text when it is relevant to understand the happenings.
#### Chapter 1: The Island
I've awoken to the sounds of fighting. My first thought was that the Kulupu was finally invading. I got my *oxcidentutaröxparo* and got ready to fight until the last drop of blood. I got outside into the *jamahatasato*, and I realize what I had heard. Someone had been struck by lightning. Almost immediately, I dropped my weapon and moved over to see what the damage was.

One of the grape farmers has been struck. He is still conscious and swearing about the grapes.

*"Poj, la naximäbireko! La jamahataso kesei kraka!"* (Damn, the magic lightning! The grapes are on fire!) 

I looked around him and saw that the grapes were indeed on fire. I went to get some water, and put out the fire.
