# Book 1: The Epic of History

### Chapter 1: The Myth of Esperantujo
Long ago, the people of the river valley spoke many languages. Then, on the island of Esperantustano, the language of Esperanto was created. The Esperantustana people conquered, migrated, and expanded until their state, "Esperantujo," included the area of Multiuridtustano, in the west, as far south as the southernmost river, and including the island of Birekuhomustano in the east.

Until it all fell apart. Raids from Occidental-speaking nomads in the west, Volap체k-speaking nomads from the northwest, and, most concerning of all, the Vore Empire, which spoke Lojban, took over much of the southern fringes.

Esperantujo fractured, and so did its language. In the south, Ido formed. In Multiuridtustano, Esperanto II developed. In the west, some Occidental dialects formed Interlingua, and on the small island of Birekuhomustano, V채idlugo developed.

While the Esperantuja people were politically and linguistically divided, they still had a common identity of Jaesperantujista. Soon, however, a new power would rise in the ashes of Esperantujo.


### Chapter 2: The Myth of Kulupu
Let's take a step back and talk about those languages that existed before Esperanto. Some, like Volap체k, Occidental, and Lojban, have already been mentioned. In addition, the Solresol language existed on the island of Mus채homustano.

But after the Esperantustana conquests, the largest pre-Esperanto language still remaining was the language called Toki Pona. Before Esperantujo, the Toki Pona community was united in a state called "Kulupu." This state was conquered by Esperantujo. After the collapse of Esperantujo began, the Kulupu declared independence from the collapsing state. Kulupu then expanded its borders across a major part of the coastal plains. However, like Esperantujo before it, Kulupu began a collapse. Eventually, the Kulupu government held control only over the capital city of Linja lon telo uta. The rest of the Toki Pona community became disunited in several city-states, and the dialects began to diverge from the standard tounge.
